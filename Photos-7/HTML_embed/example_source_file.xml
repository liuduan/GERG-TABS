<!--
This XML file contains the list of images used for the slide show. Each image can have up
to three versions: a small sized version to be used as thumbnail, a larger sized version
used as normal images and full screen sized version (the largest size) displayed while the
slide show is in the full screen mode.

Each version of the image has its own path, that has to be specifed within the appropriate
XML tags:
- <thumbnailPath></thumbnailPath> - between these two tags, you have to specify the path
and file name of the thumbnail image
- <largeImagePath></largeImagePath> - these two tags must contain the path and file name
of the normal sized image - YOU SHOULD ALWAYS SET AT LEAST THIS IMAGE
- <fullScreenImagePath></fullScreenImagePath> - these tags contain the path and file name
of the large sized images, used for the full screen view

The <title> and <description> tags contain the title and description of the image. This
information should be added inside the CDATA section. However, it is not necessary to add
title and description to the images.

For more information about XML please read this documentation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML
For more information about the structure of the source XML file, please consult the 
The Source XML File.pdf document.
